# redux-login
Simple login with react and redux

## how to start

start the client

1. `yarn` or `npm i`
2. `yarn start` or `npm start`

In another terminal start the server (not part of this repo, runs on localhost:8880)

Since server runs on different port we would face the CORS issues. To solve it open the chrome with `--disable-web-security` option. Under MacOS in terminal:

`open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --user-data-dir="/some/directory" --disable-web-security
`
